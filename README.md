###C++ to MIPS Compiler
This project is a Python-based compiler that translates C++ code into MIPS assembly language. With over 1,000 lines of code, it's a powerful tool for programmers looking to optimize their code for MIPS processors.

###How It Works
To use the C++ to MIPS Compiler, simply copy and paste your C++ code into the text editor and hit the "Run" button. The compiler will automatically translate your code into MIPS assembly language, which can then be copied to the clipboard or saved to a file.

###Features
Easy-to-use GUI for convenient code editing and compilation
Automatic line numbering for better code organization
"Clear" button to easily start over with a new code file
"Run" button to compile C++ code to MIPS assembly language
"Copy" button to quickly copy MIPS assembly code to clipboard
"Open" button to load contents of file to text editor
"Save" button to save compiled MIPS assembly code to file
Error messages for syntax and other errors during compilation

###Getting Started
To get started using the C++ to MIPS Compiler, simply download the repository and run the "compiler.py" file. This will open the GUI and allow you to start editing and compiling your C++ code.
